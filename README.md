#Development and Demonstration of a Sensor-Based Method for Monitoring Container Substrate Fertility
##Introduction
Substrate electrical conductivity (EC) measurement is a required Best Management Practice (BMP) for the application of supplemental fertilizers in nursery and greenhouse industries to protect and conserve water resources. The current method of measuring substrate EC is through the Pour-through (PT) procedure, a multi-step method in which representative plants are selected for EC measurement, and a predetermined volume of water is poured on the surface of each test plant. The resulting leachate is collected and EC is determined using an EC meter. This process can be extensive for large-scale nursery production zones, requiring a significant amount of time and manual labor. With the personnel shortages that exist in production nurseries, technologies are needed to improve and optimize EC measurement and recordkeeping so the BMP is effective. This project aims to develop a new, sensor-based method for measuring EC to reduce the time invested by producers compared to the current PT method and provide real-time information on the fertility status of container-grown plants.
